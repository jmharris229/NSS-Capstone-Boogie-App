# NSS-Capstone-Boogiemeter-App

This is my front-end capstone for NSS. 

GET READY TO BOOGIE! This app is called the 'Boogiemeter' and is here to get you movin' 'n' groovin' at concerts by creating a competitive "dance-off" environment for you and your friends, while helping you get engaged in a helathy lifestyle using that Fitbit at the show. 

"SAY WAHHHTT??"

You heard me right. How this app works, is a user will first search for an artist and select a concert that they plan to attend in the future. Once it has come time for the concert, the user simple starts the tracking process of steps from Fitbit.Once the concert is over, the user simply "STOPS" the tracking and the user is automatically given a score, based on how much they danced at the concert. 

The score is saved to your profile and available to see by all of your friends. Not only can a friend see your scores, but concert attendees are able to see a live updating feed of other attendees and their scores, automatically sorting by highest to lowest. So after the dust settles, you know who danced their butts off out of all of your friends and can claim the title of "Lord of the Lawn (general lawn)"!
